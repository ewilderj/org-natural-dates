* org-natural-dates
Natural language date parsing for Org mode scheduling, deadlines, and capture.

** Overview
`org-natural-dates` enables you to use natural language—like "every Friday at 3pm", "tomorrow", or "next Tuesday"—when scheduling tasks or setting deadlines in Org mode. It works seamlessly as a wrapper around the standard `org-schedule` and `org-deadline` commands, both in regular Org buffers and the Org Agenda.

** Installation

*** MELPA (Coming Soon)
Once published on MELPA, you will be able to install using:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
M-x package-install RET org-natural-dates RET
#+END_SRC

*** Manual
1. Clone this repository to your Emacs `load-path`.
2. Add the following to your `init.el`:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-natural-dates")
(require 'org-natural-dates)
#+END_SRC

*** Configuration
To get the most out of `org-natural-dates`, bind its commands to the standard Org scheduling keys:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; Rebind in standard org-mode
(with-eval-after-load 'org
  (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-s") 'org-natural-dates-schedule)
  (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-d") 'org-natural-dates-deadline))

;; Rebind in org-agenda
(with-eval-after-load 'org-agenda
  (define-key org-agenda-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-s") 'org-natural-dates-agenda-schedule)
  (define-key org-agenda-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-d") 'org-natural-dates-agenda-deadline))
#+END_SRC

** Usage

When you invoke `C-c C-s` (now bound to `org-natural-dates-schedule`), you will be prompted with =Scheduled to:=. You can type any of the following natural language formats:

- *Relative dates:* "tomorrow", "today", "in 3 days"
- *Times:* "at 5pm", "19:00"
- *Recurrences:* "every day", "every 2 weeks", "every Friday"
- *Complex:* "every Monday at 10am"

If you provide a prefix argument (e.g., `C-u C-c C-s`), the command will fall back to the standard `org-schedule` behavior (e.g., to remove a scheduled date or use the calendar).

*** Org Capture Integration
You can also use this package to capture tasks with natural dates in one go.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
             '("n" "Natural Task" entry (file+headline "~/gtd/inbox.org" "Tasks")
               "* TODO %(org-natural-dates-get :text)\n%(org-natural-dates-get-timestamp-line)\n:PROPERTIES:\n:CREATED: %U\n:END:\n"))

(global-set-key (kbd "C-c n") 'org-natural-dates)
#+END_SRC

Press `C-c n`, type "Call Dave tomorrow at 5pm", and select the "n" template to capture the task with the correct schedule. Deadlines are automatically detected during capture via keywords (e.g., "due Friday", "deadline in 3 days", "by tomorrow").

GPLv3. See LICENSE for details.

** Development
We use [[https://github.com/alphapapa/makem.sh][makem.sh]] for linting (`checkdoc`, `package-lint`) and testing.

To run the linters and tests locally, you can use `makem.sh`. Note that on macOS, `makem.sh` requires GNU `coreutils` (specifically `gdate` and `gmktemp`) to be installed via Homebrew.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alphapapa/makem.sh/master/makem.sh -o makem.sh
chmod +x makem.sh

# Run tests
./makem.sh test

# Run linters
./makem.sh lint
#+END_SRC

Continuous integration is automatically set up via GitHub Actions to verify these rules across Emacs 27, 28, and 29.
